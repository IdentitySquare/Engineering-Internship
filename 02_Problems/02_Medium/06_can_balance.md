# Can Balance?

Given a non-empty array, return true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.

```
canBalance?([1, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → true
canBalance?([2, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → false
canBalance?([10, 10]) → true
```
