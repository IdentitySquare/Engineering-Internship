# zipZap

Look for patterns like "zip" and "zap" in the string -- length-3, starting with 'z' and ending with 'p'. Return a string where for all such words, the middle letter is gone, so "zipXzap" yields "zpXzp".

```
zipZap("zipXzap") → "zpXzp"
zipZap("zopzop") → "zpzp"
zipZap("zzzopzop") → "zzzpzp"
```
