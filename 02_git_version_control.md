## Tasks
1. Create a new GitHub repo in your personal account called "Problem-Solving"
2. To that repo, create one new pull request for each of the easy problem solving questions you solved on repl.it. Do not merge the Pull Requests. 
3. At the end of that you will have about 20 pull requests open. 
4. We will review each of the code for algorithm, performance, good code, etc. 
5. One the Pull Requests comments have been addressed - i.e. you fix them, update the code in the pull request, we will merge those Pull Requests.

This is how production work flow works for code reviews and how only good working code is merged into the main branch.
