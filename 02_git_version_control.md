## Learning
Estimated Duration: 1-2 days

Learning Outcomes:
1. What is Git and why we need version control. 
2. Git commit.
3. Git checkout.
4. Git branching.
5. Git merging.
6. Difference between Git & GitHub.
7. Creating a GitHub repo & pushing your code.
8. Pull request.
9. Review workflow & merging pull requests.


## Tasks
Estimated Duration: 4 hours for PR created with code update & description for the PR + additional 1-2 days for reviewing feedback, making correction and finally getting it approved to be merged. 

1. Create a new GitHub repo in your personal account called "Problem-Solving"
2. To that repo, create one new pull request for each of the easy problem solving questions you solved on repl.it. Do not merge the Pull Requests. 
3. At the end of that you will have about 20 pull requests open. 
4. We will review each of the code for algorithm, performance, good code, etc. 
5. One the Pull Requests comments have been addressed - i.e. you fix them, update the code in the pull request, we will approve those Pull Requests.
6. Once the PR is approved, you can merge the PR. 

This is how production work flow works for code reviews and how only good working code is merged into the main branch.
