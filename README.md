# Software Engineering Internship
Welcome to the [Identity Square](https://identitysquare.com) Full-Stack Software Engineering Internship. At the end of the 6-month full-time internship, you would have received the training, support, feedback and production application experience to call yourself a junior software engineer.

The internship is split in two:
1. **Training & Feedback** - learning all the basics to be able to build a web application. Front-end and back-end.
2. **Hands-on experience** - this is where most of your learning will occur while building production applications.
