# Local Computer Setup

A Luinix system is easier to work with. You will have the easiest time setting up if you are on a mac or Ubuntu. 
You can setup in Windows but you might have issues. You can try Googling for tutorials on this. We'd recommend that you install Ubuntu as a second OS or atleast in a Virtual Machine to try it out. 

## Things todo:

1. Install Ruby & a Ruby Version Manager (RVM or similar)
2. Install Code Editor - your personal preference. We use Atom or VS Code. 
3. Git Install & Config

Helpful additional tools:
* GitHub client 
* RuboCop autocorrect plugin for your editor
* Good terminal & plugins
