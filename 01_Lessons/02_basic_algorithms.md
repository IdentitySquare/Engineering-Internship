## 1. Basic Algorithms
Estimated Duration: 5-7 days - doing an average of 4 questions a day.

Running code online: [Repl.it](http://repl.it)

Practice questions:
**[Easy Problems &rarr;](https://github.com/IdentitySquare/Engineering-Internship/tree/main/Problems/Easy)**

For some of the questions, you might need understanding of the next two sections of searching & sorting algorithms.


## 2. Searching Algorithms
The following links are in another language, but you should be able to read, understand the C code & manually convert it to Ruby.

* [Introduction](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/search-algorithms)
* [Linear Search](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/linear-search-algorithm)
* [Binary Search](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/binary-search-algorithm)


## 3. Sorting Algorithms
Plenty of resources online for this in many programming languages. Study, understand & write a code that you can reproduce yourself.

* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
