# Your Computer

## 1. Local Computer Setup
*Estimated time: Varies on your computer, setup and issues you might run into. Could range from an hour to a full day if you encounter issues.*

A Lunix system is easier to work with. You will have the easiest time setting up if you are on macOS or Ubuntu.

**Windows**: You can setup in Windows but you might have issues. You can try Googling for tutorials on this. We strongly recommend that you install Ubuntu as a second OS or at least in a Virtual Machine.

1. ✅ Install Ruby, Git & a Ruby Version Manager (RVM or similar). **[Guide →](http://www.installrails.com)**
2. ✅ Install Code Editor - your personal preference. We use [Atom](https://atom.io) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Helpful additional tools:
* RuboCop autocorrect plugin for your editor - corrects your code to follow Rubocop style guide
* Good terminal & plugins

## 2. Command Line Basics
a.k.a. shell, terminal, console, prompt.

*Estimated time: 4 hours*
