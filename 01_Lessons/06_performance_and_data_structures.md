## 3. Performance Optomisation
Estimated time: 2 hours to read & understand.

You can solve the same problem in multiple ways. Some solutions are more time & resources intensive than others.
We always want to optomise our code to the best performing code as possible. Some of the factors that will affect performance are the number of loops, nested loops, inefficient searching of arrays each time (lookup times), etc.

We will be using this knowledge to build our algorithms with code performance in mind.


## 4. More "Intersting" Algorithms

As before, create a new PR for each solution. Each solution should have Minitests which tests your code.
