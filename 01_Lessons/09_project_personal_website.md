# Personal Project

Use bootstrap to build a personal **one-page website** to showcase your experience and skills. Host your static website via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). 

1. Design your web page for desktop and mobile. Some inspiration below.
2. Setup a new GitHub repo as required by GitHub Pages. 
3. Build your static webpage design with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/), test and push to GitHub. 


## Design Considerations

* Make it clean, modern & professional. Something you will be proud of to show on your profile and share with others. 
* Avoid heavy javascript interactions to keep this simple but include any quick interactions and functionality via JS. 
* Build with responsive design - should look great on mobile + desktop and all screen sizes in between. 
* Be bold to use custom CSS to bring your design to life. It should not look stock bootstrap in the end.
* Don't use any copyrighted images. Use public domain images or images you have full rights to.
