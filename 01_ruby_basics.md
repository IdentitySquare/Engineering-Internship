For some of the questions, you might need understanding of the next two sections of searching & sorting algorithms. 


# 4. Searching Algorithms
The following links are in another language, but you should be able to read, understand the C code & manually convert it to Ruby.

* [Introduction](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/search-algorithms)
* [Linear Search](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/linear-search-algorithm)
* [Binary Search](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/binary-search-algorithm)


# 5. Sorting Algorithms
Plenty of resources online for this in many programming languages. Study, understand & write a code that you can reproduce yourself. 

* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
