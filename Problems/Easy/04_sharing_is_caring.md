# Sharing is Caring

Given an array of numbers, create a function that removes 25% from every number in the array except the smallest number, and adds the total amount removed to the smallest number.

## Examples
```
show_the_love([4, 1, 4]) ➞ [3, 3, 3]

show_the_love([16, 10, 8]) ➞ [12, 7.5, 14.5]

show_the_love([2, 100]) ➞ [27, 75]
```

## Notes
There will only be one smallest number in a given array.
