# Emotify the Sentence

Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticons.


word | emoticon
-- | --
smile | :D
grin | :)
sad | :(
mad | :P


Examples

```
emotify("Make me smile") ➞ "Make me :D"

emotify("Make me grin") ➞ "Make me :)"

emotify("Make me sad") ➞ "Make me :("
```

Notes

The sentence always starts with "Make me".
Try to solve this without using conditional statements like if/else.
